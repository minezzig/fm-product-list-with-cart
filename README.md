## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- React
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- fetch data from json file
- Picture element

### What I learned

This project is an example of what I love! It was great practice for React components, and I had a lot of fun connecting them all together. This project showcases my ability to use Tailwind to design a simple yet effective page that allows users to select the food items they want, as well as the quantity. Using CSS, users can visually see which items have been included in their cart.

From doing this project, I learned how important visual cues are. By simply changing colors or adding borders, users receive visual feedback that actions have taken place.

### Continued development

I'm planning to go back and add more transitions and animations to the page. I would like elements to be added to the cart with more visual feedback, such as sliding in. Additionally, I think adding some motion to the food images when a user hovers over them would be fun, hinting that they can be clicked on.
